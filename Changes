Revision history for Perl extension NetAthlon2::RAW

0.11 Sun Nov  8 15:20:07 EST 2009
	- Fix make test, set TZ to be EDT so Start Time values are correct.

0.10 Sun Oct 25 18:09:10 2009
	- Add NetAthlon::RAW::timeDelta variable to adjust the slop between
		the time in the filename and the start time within the file.
	- Add NetAthlon::RAW::maxWatts variable to ignore unrealistically large
		values in the Average Watts calculation.
	- Add Calculated Distance keys in both the Check Point and summary
		values.
	- Recalculate the Average Speed based on the Calculated Distance in
		the summary level and the Elapsed Time.  This is because the
		Elapsed Time is based on only the race time, whereas the 
		Distance is based on the race time and warmup time.
