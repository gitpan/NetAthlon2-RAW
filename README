NAME
    NetAthlon2::RAW - Perl extension to parse NetAthlon2 RAW performance
    data files

SYNOPSIS
     use NetAthlon2::RAW;

     my $t = NetAthlon2::RAW->new ();
     my $d = $t->parse('Bike2009-07-02 5-54pm.RAW');

DESCRIPTION
    A perl module to parse the NetAthlon RAW file format. parse() will
    return a hash reference to the resultant data structure

METHODS
    new()
        Creates a new NetAthlon2::RAW object. new() does not accept any
        options at this time.

    parse($file)
        Returns a hash reference with the contents of $file. Keys included
        are:

        Average Cadence
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Cadence values from
            the Check Points array.

        Average Heart Rate
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Heart Rate values
            from the Check Points array.

        Average Speed
            Calculation of the Speed from the Elapsed Time and Distance.

        Average Watts
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Watts values from
            the Check Points array.

        Check Points
            This is an array of each sample taken during the training
            session. Each array element is an anonmyous hash with the
            following keys:

            Altitude
                The instantaenous Altitude at the Elapsed Time.

            Cadence
                The instantaenous Cadence at the Elapsed Time.

            Elapsed Time
                A calculation of when the sample was taken, based on the
                number of samples collected multiplied by the Sample Rate.
                Number is in seconds.

            Grade
                The instantaenous Grade at the Elapsed Time.

            Heart Rate
                The instantaenous Heart Rate at the Elapsed Time.

            Speed
                The instantaenous Speed at the Elapsed Time. Number is in
                miles per hour.

            Watts
                The instantaenous Watts at the Elapsed Time.

        Distance
            The overall Distance of the training session, in miles.

        Elapsed Time
            The time of the training session, in seconds.

        Heart Rate
            Values taken from the training session.

            Aerobic Threshold
            Anaerobic Threshold
            Zone 1
                The highest training zone.

                Max
                Min

            Zone 2
                The second training zone.

                Max
                Min

            Zone 3
                The bottom training zone.

                Max
                Min

        Sample Rate
            Number of seconds between each Check Point sample.

        Start Time
            The start time of the training session, in a UNIX time_t format.

NOTES
    I believe that the field that Martin lists on his web site
    (www.whitepeak.org) as the Grade of the course is not. In all my testing
    the Grade was 0, whereas the field he listed as Unknown had positive and
    negative values, and looks to me to be Grade * 10, so I have implemented
    the code to show this deviation from Martin's documentation.
