NAME
    NetAthlon2::RAW - Perl extension to parse NetAthlon2 RAW performance
    data files

SYNOPSIS
     use NetAthlon2::RAW;

     my $t = NetAthlon2::RAW->new ();
     my $d = $t->parse('Bike2009-07-02 5-54pm.RAW');

DESCRIPTION
    A perl module to parse the NetAthlon RAW file format. parse() will
    return a hash reference to the resultant data structure

METHODS
    new()
        Creates a new NetAthlon2::RAW object. new() accepts the following
        options at this time.

        debug
            Enable debugging statements.

    parse($file)
        Returns a hash reference with the contents of $file. Keys included
        are:

        Average Cadence
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Cadence values from
            the Check Points array.

        Average Heart Rate
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Heart Rate values
            from the Check Points array.

        Average Speed
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Speed values from
            the Check Points array. Used to be just the division of the
            Distance by the Elapsed Time, but the Elapsed Time is the time
            of the race, where as the Distance is the whole distance,
            including any warmup time. This lead to incorrect Average Speed
            calculations in version 0.01.

        Average Watts
            Calculation of the averages of the non-zero Watts values from
            the Check Points array.

        Cadence
            The overall Cadence of the training session, in miles.

        Check Points
            This is an array of each sample taken during the training
            session. Each array element is an anonymous hash with the
            following keys:

            Altitude
                The instantaneous Altitude at the Elapsed Time.

            Cadence
                The instantaneous Cadence at the Elapsed Time.

            Elapsed Time
                A calculation of when the sample was taken, based on the
                number of samples collected multiplied by the Sample Rate.
                Number is in seconds.

            Grade
                The instantaneous Grade at the Elapsed Time.

            Heart Rate
                The instantaneous Heart Rate at the Elapsed Time.

            Speed
                The instantaneous Speed at the Elapsed Time. Number is in
                miles per hour.

            Watts
                The instantaneous Watts at the Elapsed Time.

        Distance
            The overall Distance of the training session, in miles.

        Elapsed Time
            The time of the training session, in seconds.

        Heart Rate
            Values taken from the training session.

            Aerobic Threshold
                The aerobic threshold based on the users Max Heart Rate.

            Anaerobic Threshold
                The anaerobic threshold based on the users Max Heart Rate.

            Zone 1
                The highest training zone.

                Max The max heart rate for zone 1.

                Min The min heart rate for zone 1.

            Zone 2
                The second training zone.

                Max The max heart rate for zone 2.

                Min The min heart rate for zone 2.

            Zone 3
                The bottom training zone.

                Max The max heart rate for zone 3.

                Min The min heart rate for zone 3.

        Max Heart Rate
            The Max Heart Rate throught the Check Points array.

        Max Cadence
            The Max Cadence throught the Check Points array.

        Max Heart Rate
            The Max Heart Rate throught the Check Points array.

        Max Speed
            The Max Speed throught the Check Points array.

        Max Watts
            The Max Watts throught the Check Points array.

        Sample Rate
            Number of seconds between each Check Point sample.

        Start Time
            The start time of the training session, in a UNIX time_t format.

VARIABLES
    $timeDelta
        Number of minutes the time listed in the file name and the time
        listed inside the file can vary before throwing an error. The
        default is 1 minute.

NOTES
    I believe that the field that Martin lists on his web site
    (www.whitepeak.org) as the Grade of the course is not. In all my testing
    the Grade was 0, whereas the field he listed as Unknown had positive and
    negative values, and looks to me to be Grade * 10, so I have implemented
    the code to show this deviation from Martin's documentation.

    Based on some empirical data, I believe the Unknown value listed after
    the Distance, is really Cadence for the entire time. I have added the
    Cadence field in addition to Average Cadence.
